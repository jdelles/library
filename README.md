## Introduction
This is the first project in the JavaScript track at The Odin Project. It uses Object Oriented Programming to create 'book' objects and stores them in a library which can return various information about the books to the user. 

## Skill to be demonstrated
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- Firebase DB 

## Tools used
- VSCode
- Live Server
- Git / GitHub

## To do 
- [X] If you haven’t already, set up your project with skeleton HTML/CSS and JS files.
- [ ] Create book object and constructor
- [ ] Create library array to hold books and add book to library
- [ ] Write a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page. You can display them in some sort of table, or each on their own “card”. 
- [ ] Add a “NEW BOOK” button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: author, title, number of pages, whether it’s been read and anything else you might want.
- [ ] Add a button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library.
- [ ] Add a button on each book’s display to change its read status.
- [ ] (Optional) localStorage - Set up a function that saves the whole library array to localStorage every time a new book is created, and another function that looks for that array in localStorage when your app is first loaded. 
- [ ] (Optional) Firebase
- [ ] Style points - make books display as table or as cards 
- [ ] Publish to GitHub
